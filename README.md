# Coffee Machine Using Habit

This is the first repository ever created by a pretty young lady!  
The coffee machine in T-room we used everyday need to be paied volunteeringly with 25p, which is difficult to have everyday. I would not have those coins exactly 25p, and the stratage I use is pay advanced and enjoy later.  
We are interested in how oftern other people use the same appliance and what stratage they use to pay.
