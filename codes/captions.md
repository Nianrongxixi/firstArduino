## Slide 1

This is project Coffee Sense. Coffee Sense try to understand how people, in T-room, schedule their payment for the use of coffee machine.

## Slide 2 (change) 11-17 => 0-5 s

People may drop coins and get the coffee, or just have the coffee for that time.

## Slide 3 original: 22-35

The distance between users and the machine, motion of users, and loudness in the envirnoment can direct to the status of the machine.

The distance, motion, and the drop of coins can direct to the status of payment.

## Slides 4-5 (change) 36-41 => 6-21 s

We met and solved problems such as: how to fitness, sensitivity, and accuracy is; integration of modules; have a functional code; decorate and deploy the installation; risk of short circuit between modules; power supply.

## Slides 6

We demonstrate to test, and modify codes accordingly.

## Slides 7

Also decorate the release to integrate different modules as well as to achieve a better appearance.

## Slides 8 original: 54-58 s

Then deploy the installation and record data for a week.

## Slides 9

This is a part of data collected. There are distance, pir for motion, and vibration for the drop of coins. We could guess the part inside the red box may be the machine working time.

## Slides 10 remove original 1:12 - 1:13

The loudness inside the red box would be difficult to understand to find what's going on.

## Slides 11

Fortunately, With Fourier Transformation, we could transform signal to frequency domain, which shows the distribution of different component of frequencies.

## Slides 12 (change) new record: 37-44s

Comparing to frequencies of working, the frequency plot of other periods has a significant lack of bars in high frequency.
